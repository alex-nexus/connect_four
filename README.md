# In the language of your choice, design and build a connect four game.
# You might not have enough time to implement a working version of the game and that’s ok.  Below are the aspects of your program that we will be assessing.  It’s ok if you don’t get to all of them but address the items that you feel best showcase your skills first.
#
#
# a) Code layout - what classes and functions do you need for your game.
#
# b) The function for identifying a legal move.
#
# c) The function for identifying a winning game state.
#
# d) Testing automation - how will you structure your tests. In the interest of time feel free to just convey your test strategy with just test names and/of pseudo code.
